Molecule now fully supports Scala 3.

A bug in the [sbt-molecule](https://github.com/scalamolecule/sbt-molecule) plugin missed to pack new Scala 3 `.tasty` files into the generated jar file with Molecule boilerplate code. Now that it does, everything works like a charm.

Make sure to add the latest version of sbt-molecule in your `project/plugins.sbt` :

    addSbtPlugin("org.scalamolecule" % "sbt-molecule" % "1.8.1")

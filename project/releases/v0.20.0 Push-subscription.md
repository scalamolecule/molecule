v0.20.0 Push-subscriptions


## Push-based subscriptions

Subscriptions defined on the JS side now establish a websocket connection that from the server pushes the query result to the client whenever one of the involved attributes participate in subsequent mutations.

The server module shows how websockets are handled with the various tapir backends.


## DataModel

Instead of building a `List` of `Element`s, a proper `DataModel` is built when composing molecules. Mutable `Array`s are substituted with `IArray`. So now the `DataModel` is fully immutable.


## `db` namespace

All database related modules are now grouped within the `db` namespace. 

Boilerplate generation code is moved outside in a separate non-published namespace to avoid polluting the `db` modules.

The plan is to adapt Molecule to access data from other data sources fetched with GraphQL, REST etc. These implementations will then each get their own namespace.

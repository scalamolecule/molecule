v0.2.0 SPI implemented for H2

Molecule is now fully implemented for the [H2](https://h2database.com/html/main.html) database on both the JVM and JS platforms!

Composites and TxMetaData has been dropped - see comments [here](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule/commit/ff1b75585ddbc3218f10ffa431fc8df40cadccab). This makes compilation much faster and simplifies the api to core functionality that will satisfy the majority of all query and transaction needs of most projects.

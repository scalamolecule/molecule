v0.1.0 Initial release of molecule for multiple databases

This is a complete re-coded library based on years of active development of the [molecule-old](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-old) library that only targeted the Datomic database.

This new library targets both Datomic and JDBC-compliant sql databases, and more are to be added. The Datomic implementation is quite complete while the JDBC implementation is still work-in-progress.

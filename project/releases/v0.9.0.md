This is a big release with a lot of fundamental changes.

### Letting go of MongDB

Realising that Molecule likely won't appeal to the schema-less use cases of Mongo. Besides, Mongo with it's two data models (embedded/referenced) is a nightmare to implement. Possible, but likely not worth it.

Some background examples of thoughts against Mongo:

### Welcoming SQlite

SQlite is now implemented in Molecule. It's fast.


### General improvements

- Improved Map api and key/value handling.
- More powerful and clear update/upsert semantics allowing updating across relationships!
- Distinction between Seqs of all primitive types except Byte that is saved in an Array for serialization etc.
- General focusing of expression api.
- Aggregation of collection types dropped to keep things simple and focused.
- RawQuery now return List[List[Any]] - dropping futile attempt at returning a typed result. Raw is raw.

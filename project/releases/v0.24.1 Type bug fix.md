# v0.24.1 Type bug fix

Correct types are now returned after using expressions on attributes.

This release requires using version 1.19.4 of the sbt-molecule. Set in `project/plugins.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("org.scalamolecule" % "sbt-molecule" % "1.19.4")

Re-generate your DSL with `sbt moleculeGen` and types should work correctly.

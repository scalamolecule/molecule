v0.18.0 Scala 3

Molecule is a library that introduces a completely new approach to data modeling and database access. 

This will most likely mainly attract Scala developers exploring new projects and concepts rather than scala 2.13/2.12 project maintainers. Molecule has no adoption yet and it is therefore a natural decision to look forward with Scala 3 only from now on. 

Plus it avoids binary compatibility issues with Scala 2.13/2.12 for various effect and database systems. Now we can for instance work on Monix streaming from Tapir backend to client (only available in Scala 3). 

Magnum, Tyrian and other libraries have already choosing Scala 3 only forward, and this is a natural choice for Molecule as well.

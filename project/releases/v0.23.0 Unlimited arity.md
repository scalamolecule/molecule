##  v0.23.0 – Unlimited Arity

This is the biggest update to Molecule yet!

Molecule now leverages **Scala 3.7's composable Tuples** and **polymorphic functions** to dramatically simplify and generalize the DSL internals — while keeping the expressive, type-safe API intact.


### From Arity-Specific to Tuple-Based DSL

Previously, Molecule generated boilerplate for each arity of each entity:

```scala
class Person_0
class Person_1[A]
class Person_2[A, B]
class Person_3[A, B, C]
class Person_4[A, B, C, D]
class Person_5[A, B, C, D, E]
// ...
```

With the new Tuple-based architecture, we now only generate **three core shapes**:

```scala
class Person_0               // No output attributes
class Person_1[T]            // One scalar attribute
class Person_n[Tpl <: Tuple] // Two or more attributes in a tuple
```

That’s it! Molecules can now contain **100+ attributes** with no boilerplate explosion.  
Tests with **23 attributes** run smoothly and without any hiccups.


### Scala 3.7 Required

Molecule now targets the latest Scala version.  
To use this release, your project must be built with **Scala 3.7.1**.


### Type-Level Magic – Tuple Manipulation

Scala 3.7 brings powerful tools like `Tuple`, `Init`, and `: *` to manipulate types at compile time.

Consider this molecule:

```scala
val cityCountPerCountry: List[(String, Int)] =
  Country.name.city(count).query.get
```

Here, `apply(count)` transforms the `city` attribute’s output type from `String` to `Int`.

Previously, this required updating type parameters (e.g., from `B = String` to `B = Int`) and duplicating expression boilerplate across all arities.  
Now, we simply use:

```scala
Tpl :* String         // Add type to the Tuple
Init[Tpl] :* Int      // Replace last type in the Tuple
```

This allows expressive, type-safe transformations — with **far less generated code**.

Internally, we use polymorphic functions like:

```scala
[tpl <: Tuple] => (dm: DataModel) => new Country_n[tpl](dm)
```

to thread updated tuple types through Molecule’s expression traits, enabling seamless transformations like `apply(count)` while retaining precise static types.

### Clean Domain Definitions – No More Arity Config

The `maxArity` parameter in `DomainStructure` is no longer needed.

You can now define your domain structure simply as:

```scala
object Country extends DomainStructure {
  // Entity/Attribute definitions...
}
```

And Molecule will generate only the **minimal DSL code** required — with no risk of "arity explosion".


### Compile Time Improvements

Thanks to the dramatically reduced codebase, compilation times have **improved by 20–30%** in most test projects.  
This also means faster iteration cycles during development.

Production size domain definitions with 1000+ Attributes in 80+ entities have been tested to compile and work smoothly.


### Summary

- Replaced arity-specific boilerplate with tuple-based DSL generation
- Enabled support for **unlimited arity molecules**
- Migrated to **Scala 3.7.1**
- Improved **compilation times by 20–30%**
- Removed `maxArity` configuration
- Retained full **type safety and expressiveness** via type-level programming

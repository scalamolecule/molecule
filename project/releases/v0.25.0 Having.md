# v0.25.0 Having

Molecule now supports operations on aggregated values - what `having` in a SQL is for. 

So we would for instance find number of Customers in Countries that _have more than 5 customers_ with the following SQL query:

```scala
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
  GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
```
We can now express this with a molecule:

```scala
Customer.id(count).>(5).country
```

### Operations on aggregation values

```scala
Customer.id(count)(5).country     // Countries with 5 customers
Customer.id(count).not(5).country // Countries not with 5 customers
Customer.id(count).<(5).country   // Countries with less than 5 customers
Customer.id(count).>(5).country   // Countries with more than 5 customers
Customer.id(count).<=(5).country  // Countries with maximum 5 customers
Customer.id(count).>=(5).country  // Countries with minimum 5 customers
```

### Sorting of aggregated values

And once we have filtered the aggregated value, we can also sort by the aggregated values:

```scala
Customer.id(count).not(5).d1.country // Countries not with 5 customers, descending customer count
Customer.id(count).<(5).a1.country   // Countries with less than 5 customers, ascending customer count
Customer.id(count).>(5).d1.country   // Countries with more than 5 customers, descending customer count
Customer.id(count).<=(5).a1.country  // Countries with maximum 5 customers, ascending customer count
Customer.id(count).>=(5).d1.country  // Countries with minimum 5 customers, descending customer count
```

### Aggregations with operations

The following aggregate functions with optional operations are available for all cardinality-one attributes:
```
count
countDistinct
min
max
sample
```

The following aggregate functions with optional operations are available for all cardinality-one number attributes:
```
sum
median
avg
variance
stddev
```

### Aggregations without operations

Aggregated Sets of values don't have operations:
```
min(n)
max(n)
samples(n)
distinct
```

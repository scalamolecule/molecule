# Molecule v0.24.0 – SQL focus

This release marks a new chapter for Molecule: full focus on SQL backends. All Datomic-related code and infrastructure have been removed, resulting in a cleaner, more focused, and more powerful Molecule going forward.

## Goodbye Datomic

Molecule’s early support for Datomic played a key role in its evolution, but it also brought challenges:

- Diverging APIs due to Datomic limitations — like pull semantics — that couldn’t fully align with Molecule’s expressive model
- Workarounds and complexity added to compensate for backend differences
- Conditional compliance tests scattered across the codebase
- Fragmentation of the Molecule mental model across backends

This release simplifyes the core and let Molecule fully embrace the capabilities of SQL.

## A Single Unified Query Model

SQL provides richer composability and with Datomic gone, Molecule can now fully support powerful constructs that were previously constrained:

- Deeply nested optional joins  
  _e.g. get books with or without reviews, optionally filtered by rating_
- Optional paths at any level  
  _e.g. retrieve countries with or without cities, cities with or without mayors_
- Combinable conditions across attributes and nested layers
  _e.g. optional pattern matches, null-aware filters_
- Rich card-many joins with filtering, ordering, slicing
- Native support for sorting, limit, and offset  
  _(previously only possible in memory after querying full result sets)_

This model aligns more closely with how we mentally structure data, allowing the full expressiveness of the Molecule DSL to shine — without backend compromises.

## Simplified Project Structure

With the removal of Datomic:

- All modules are now SQL-only
- Module references are shorter and clearer
- The project structure is leaner and easier to navigate

This improves build performance, onboarding speed, and overall maintainability.

## Philosophy: One Powerful Molecule

By focusing entirely on SQL, Molecule can now deliver a single, consistent experience:

- One expressive, composable, nested query language
- One coherent API across all supported SQL databases
- Full optionality at every level: entities, attributes, relationships
- Uniform compliance across all supported backends — verified by 1800+ tests


## What's Changed

- All Datomic code and backends removed
- Project restructured for SQL-only usage
- Simplified imports and module resolution
- Minor breaking changes in DSL due to project layout cleanup

### Updated Dependencies

You can now choose any of the supported SQL databases in your sbt project:

```scala
"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule-db-postgres" % "0.24.0"
"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule-db-sqlite"   % "0.24.0"
"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule-db-mysql"    % "0.24.0"
"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule-db-mariadb"  % "0.24.0"
"org.scalamolecule" %% "molecule-db-h2"       % "0.24.0"
```

Also use the updated sbt-molecule:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scalamolecule" % "sbt-molecule" % "1.19.0")
```

Refer to the GitHub README for the latest setup instructions.

## Migration Notes

- If you’re using Datomic, please remain on Molecule v0.23.x. This release does not support Datomic and is not backwards compatible with the multi-backend structure.
- If you’re already using Molecule for SQL, upgrading to v0.24.0 should be seamless.
  Just check your import paths and module references.

v0.15.1 Namespace --> Entity

Molecule is more of an Entity-Relational model focused on Entities with a certain Scala type. The term "Namespace" came from Datomic and is more suited to their programming model of allowing any attribute from any Namespace share an entity id.

Molecule supports modelling things and concepts from the real world. A "thing" is not a "Namespace", but more of an "Entity" and we want the programming model of Molecule to stay as close as possible to our human mental model of the real world as opposed to gravitating towards programming terms.


### Test suites re-organised

All test suites have been re-organised so that they don't extent the shared actual tests anymore. This cuts the compilation time down to about a third of before.
